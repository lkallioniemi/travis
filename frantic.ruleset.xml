		We may want a middle ground though. The best way to do this is add the
		entire ruleset, then rule by rule, remove ones that don't suit a project. We
		can do this by running `phpcs` with the '-s' flag, to see the names of the
		different Sniffs, as their rules are broken. From here, we can opt to
		exclude problematic sniffs like so.
